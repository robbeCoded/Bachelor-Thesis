# 1. Introduction and Motivation

# 2. Basics
- Framework vs Library

## 2.1 Cross-Platform Development
Definition and significance of cross-platform development

### 2.1.1 Types of Cross-Platform Applications
- Hybrid-Apps
- Progressive Web Apps (PWAs)
- Compiled to Native Apps
- Multiplatform Native Apps
- Server-Driven-UI?

### 2.1.2 Common Challenges in Cross-Platform Development

## 2.2 Kotlin Multiplatform
- Definition, explanation and the aim of KMP.
- How does code sharing work
- Difference to other cross-platform approaches

### 2.2.1 

# 3. Related Work
- A lot of scientific literature on framework evaluations for specific aspects (file system access, performance,...)
- A lot of literature on framework comparisons, but without a unified way of comparison

## 3.1 Evaluation of Cross-Platform Development Approaches for app-enabled Devices
- Seminar work of HeitkÃ¶tter et. al
- Rieger and Mejchrzak:
  - Comprehensive, exhaustive and well defined criteria catalogue for cross-platform app development frameworks
  - Catalogue works for "app-enabled" devices
  - Modern frameworks allow for building applications for mobile, desktop and web at once
  - Kotlin Multiplatform offers cross-platform in a new and unique way => need to revise some of the criteria
  - Need for catalogue that can evaluate frameworks on their web capabilities as well

## 3.2 Evaluation of Web Development Approaches

# 4. Revised set of criteria to evaluate modern cross-platform frameworks with web development capabilities
- Explain which criteria need to be updated
- Which criteria need to be added based on literature from 3.2 and expert interviews
- Present the revised criteria catalogue

# 5. Evaluation of Kotlin Multiplatform for Cross-Platform Development of Mobile/Android and Web Applications
Survey of how developers would evaluate Kotlin Multiplatform with the revised criteria catalogue
- Analyze Survey
- Present findings

# 6. Discussion 
- How suitable is the revised catalogue to evaluate modern cross-platform frameworks?
- Would the evaluation of other frameworks like Flutter, React Native or Xamarin work likewise?
- Need for more/revised criteria to evaluate desktop as well?
- Discuss survey findings
