\chapter{Expert-Driven Refinement of the Evaluation Framework}

This chapter aims to refine the evaluation framework proposed by Rieger and Majchrzak (2019) for cross-platform app development, with a specific focus on its applicability to web development. While the original framework provides a comprehensive basis for app development, its suitability for evaluating the web development capabilities of a given cross-platform framework is not yet established.
