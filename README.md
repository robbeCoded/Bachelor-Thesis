# Evaluating Kotlin Multiplatform for cross-platform development of Android and Web Applications (BA)

## Introduction and Motivation

The significance of mobile applications and websites as end-user platforms has increased significantly over the past decade. Today, nearly every industry uses these platforms to interact with customers, provide services, and conduct business operations. As this trend continues, there is a greater demand than ever for cost-effective and efficient software development that targets multiple platforms.

In contrast, traditional approaches to software development frequently require keeping separate codebases for various platforms. This fragmented approach not only increases development and maintenance costs, but can also lead to platform inconsistencies and a variety of other potential issues.

In response to these challenges, the IT industry has witnessed a rise in the development and adoption of cross-platform frameworks. These frameworks offer the appealing possibility of ''write once, run anywhere,'' allowing developers to maintain a single codebase that can be deployed across multiple platforms. This strategy has the potential to streamline the development process, reduce costs, and assure a uniform user experience across all platforms.

However, the market for cross-platform frameworks is extremely competitive, with numerous options available, each with its own set of advantages and disadvantages. This variety represents a double-edged sword for organizations. On the one hand, it provides a great deal of flexibility in selecting the framework that best meets their particular requirements. On the other hand, it poses a huge challenge: how to select the most appropriate technology or framework for their particular use case.
Given the significance of this decision and its complexity, there is an urgent need for a more structured and exhaustive method of evaluating cross-platform frameworks.

Yet, defining a list of requirements is only part of the solution. Equally important is the evaluation of how well existing frameworks meet these requirements.
Since Kotlin Multiplatform (KMP) has emerged as a viable option for cross-platform development as of 2023, it is among the candidates that firms can consider when deciding on the cross-platform framework that best suits their needs. KMP enables developers to share as much non-UI code as they desire while writing UI code in the platform's native language. This strategy differentiates KMP from other cross-platform frameworks, presenting both new opportunities and challenges.
However, there is currently little to no literature evaluating KMP, which hinders companies in making an informed decision about its viability. Therefore, the second part of this thesis will address this gap by evaluating Kotlin Multiplatform for cross-platform development of Android and Web applications, against the developed list of criteria. This assessment will contribute valuable insights to the industry and aid companies in deciding whether KMP is a fitting choice for them.

## Problem Statement and Goal
The problem at the heart of this thesis is the absence of an exhaustive and up-to-date set of requirements for modern cross-platform frameworks. In addition, there are insufficient empirical data concerning the performance of KMP in relation to these requirements.
The study focuses primarily on two aspects. Its primary objective is to define a list of requirements for modern cross-platform frameworks. This will be accomplished through the use of literature reviews, expert interviews and a questionnaire. Second, it will evaluate the performance of KMP for cross-platform Android and Web development against the developed set of requirements.

### Research Questions
* In the context of cross-platform development, what are the critical requirements for a modern cross-platform framework, as identified through a systematic review of existing literature, an analysis of expert opinion and a questionnaire?
* How does KMP for Android and Web development perform when evaluated against the established requirements for modern cross-platform frameworks?

### What's the goal of this work?
The goals of this bachelors-thesis are as follows: 
* To develop a comprehensive requirements catalog for modern cross-platform frameworks, derived from a systematic literature review and supplemented by expert opinions.
* To empirically evaluate the performance of KMP for Android and Web development against the established requirements catalog using a real-world application. This will provide insight into the potential and efficacy of KMP for cross-platform development.
* To create a clear, concise, and user-friendly guide to aid other researchers and industry professionals in understanding the complex field of cross-platform development.


## Approach, Outcome and Evaluation
The approach to this thesis can be categorized into three main phases: a systematic literature review, a series of interviews and a questionnaire, and an empirical evaluation of KMP.
The outcome of this thesis will be a well-developed requirements catalog for modern cross-platform frameworks and an evaluation of KMP for Android and Web development against the catalog. The result will be a comprehensive comparison of KMP with other cross-platform frameworks based on an established requirements catalog.

### Approach
* Conduct a systematic literature review to identify requirements for modern cross-platform frameworks from existing literature.
* Conduct interviews with experts in the field to validate, expand, and improve the requirements catalog.
* Develop a questionnaire based on the interviews to obtain data from a larger population and ensure the catalog's comprehensiveness and validity.

### Outcome
The outcome of the thesis will be: 
* A well-developed requirements catalog for modern cross-platform frameworks, enriched by expert insights.
* An evaluation of KMP for Android and Web development against the catalog.
* A comparison of KMP with other cross-platform frameworks based on the requirements catalog.

### Evaluation
For evaluation, I will use a Likert Scale-based evaluation to assess how well KMP does in the different categories of the catalog. Each category will receive a score on a scale of 1 to 5, with 5 indicating that KMP fully meets the requirement and 1 indicating that KMP does not meet the requirement at all. The scores will then be aggregated to give an overall rating for KMP.

## Timetable
The work is planned to be carried out according to the following schedule:

* Week 1-2: Conduct a literature review and identify initial requirements.
* Week 3-4: Conduct expert interviews and validate the initial list of requirements.
* Week 5: Develop and distribute the questionnaire.
* Week 6-7: Analyze the results of the questionnaire and refine the requirements catalog.
* Week 8-10: Evaluate KMP against the requirements catalog.
* Week 11-13: Write the thesis report and prepare for presentation.
* Week 14: Submit the final version of the thesis and present the results.
